# My React Course Projects

Welcome to my repository where I've documented my journey through a React course. Here, I've learned the fundamentals of React and built three applications: a Digital Clock, a Stopwatch, and a To-Do List.

## üï∞Ô∏è Digital Clock

This simple application displays the current time in a digital format. It updates in real-time and provides a clear representation of the current time.

### Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS

### How to Use
To use the Digital Clock application, simply open the application in your web browser. The current time will be displayed automatically.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Stopwatch

The Stopwatch application allows you to track time with start, stop, and reset functionality. It accurately measures time and provides a clear display of elapsed time.

To use the Stopwatch application, click the "Start" button to begin tracking time. Click "Stop" to pause and "Reset" to start over.
